# Madison Clojure Meetup Code of Conduct

The Madison Clojure Meetup (MCM) Code of Conduct is forked from the [MadPUG Code of Conduct](http://madpug.github.io/2013/11/15/code-of-conduct.html).

MCM is a community users' group intended for networking, collaboration, and learning in the developer community.

We value the participation of each member of the Madison community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout at all events, including Slack chat channels, whether officially sponsored by MCM or not.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout each event.

# The Short Version

MCM is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any professional venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for MCM.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event at the sole discretion of the organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

# The Longer Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for MCM.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the venue.

# Contact Information

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff. You may also contact event volunteers and ask to be put in touch with the event organizers â€” Ashley Powell, Cliff Rodgers, and Peter Schuck.

MCM volunteers will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meeting. We value your attendance.

# Procedure for Handling Harassment

MCM follows Pycon's Procedures for Handling Harassment in total.  Links to the Procedures for Attendees and Staff are provided below along with notable highlights.

MCM staff can be identified by contact information above.

If you ever feel your safety is in jeopardy please do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement by dialing 911.

## [Staff Procedure for Incident Handling](https://github.com/python/pycon-code-of-conduct/blob/master/Staff%2520Procedure%2520for%2520incident%2520handling.md)

There are also some guidelines as to what not to do as an initial response:

- Do not overtly invite them to withdraw the complaint or mention that withdrawal is OK. This suggests that you want them to do so, and is therefore coercive. "If you're OK with it [pursuing the complaint]" suggests that you are by default pursuing it and is not coercive.
-   Do not ask for their advice on how to deal with the complaint. This is a staff responsibility.
-   Do not offer them input into penalties. This is the staff's responsibility.

Once something is reported to a staff member, immediately meet with the conference chair and/or event coordinator. The main objectives of this meeting is to find out the following:

-   What happened?
-   Are we doing anything about it?
-   Who is doing those things?
-   When are they doing them?

After the staff meeting and discussion, have a staff member (preferably the conference chair or event coordinator if available) communicate with the alleged harasser. Make sure to inform them of what has been reported about them.

Allow the alleged harasser to give their side of the story to the staff. After this point, if the report stands, let the alleged harasser know what actions will be taken against them.

Some things for the staff to consider when dealing with Code of Conduct offenders:

-   Warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in sanctions
-   Requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event
-   Ending a talk that violates the policy early
-   Not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy
-   Not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at the event now or in the future
-   Immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the harasser holds
-   Requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future events your organization runs (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
-   Requiring that the harasser refund any travel grants and similar they received (this would need to be a condition of the grant at the time of being awarded)
-   Requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return
-   Banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
-   Removing a harasser from membership of relevant organizations
-   Publishing an account of the harassment and calling for the resignation of the harasser from their responsibilities (usually pursued by people without formal authority: may be called for if the harasser is the event leader, or refuses to stand aside from the conflict of interest, or similar, typically event staff have sufficient governing rights over their space that this isn't as useful)
